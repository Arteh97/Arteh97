Hello, my name is Mahamud Arteh, and I am a recently graduated full-stack engineer. I can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems, and engineering. Depending on the project I am working on, I can delve into the technologies and frameworks required to generate a well-tested and successful product.

My Education, Abilities, and Projects:

I have just completed a 14-week intensive Bootcamp at the northcoders Manchester Hub, a branch of a company that specialises in providing people with the skills to start a career in software engineering. Throughout the Bootcamp, I learned:

- The fundamentals of JavaScript/TypeScript | HTML | CSS.

- Back-End fundamentals: Test-Driven-Development | Pair-Programming | MVC principles.

- Database Management: PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Database Seeding, Testing, and Deployment.

- Front-End principles: ReactJS | the Document Object Model | App Design & Planning | Optimistic
Rendering | Hosting.

- DevOps: Continuous Deployment | Continuous Integration | Workflows(GitHub).

- Mobile App Development: React-Native/React-Native Maps, iPhone Simulator (XCode)

I learned a lot about software development while at northcoders, but the most significant thing I took from the Bootcamp, was the importance of collaborating with others. The first project I completed was the back-end of a web app built with PostgreSQL/JavaScript, and I enjoyed working with databases very much, as I was still shocked by each new thing I was learning. I also tested the database functionality by ensuring that each HTTP request sent to my database was handled promptly, without any internal error or incorrect information. Once the database was functional, Heroku was the platform that I used to host the database, and I implemented CI/CD (continuous integration/deployment) so that any changes that passed the testing phase, was then deployed as soon as possible.

After I had set up the back-end of the web application earlier in the Bootcamp, the next task was to create the front-end that would host the data held in my database. The first thing I did was enable cross-origin resource sharing, which allowed a server other than my local host to access the database. Then, I designed the basic structure of the web application that I wanted to build, using Excalidraw. Then, using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, I created a responsive multi-page web application that mocked a review website.
