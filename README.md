Hello, my name is Mahamud Arteh, and I am a recently graduated full-stack engineer. I can handle all the work of databases, servers, systems, and engineering. Depending on the project I am working on, I can delve into the technologies and frameworks required to generate a well-tested and successful product.

My Education, Abilities, and Projects:

I have just completed a 14-week intensive Bootcamp at the northcoders Manchester Hub, a branch of a company that specialises in providing people with the skills to start a career in software engineering. Throughout the Bootcamp, I learned:

- The fundamentals of JavaScript/TypeScript | HTML | CSS.

- Back-End fundamentals: Test-Driven-Development | Pair-Programming | MVC principles.

- Database Management: PostgreSQL | MongoDB | Database Seeding, Testing, and Deployment.

- Front-End principles: ReactJS | the Document Object Model | App Design & Planning | Optimistic
Rendering | Hosting.

- DevOps: Continuous Deployment | Continuous Integration | Workflows(GitHub).

- Mobile App Development: React-Native/React-Native Maps, iPhone Simulator (XCode)

- I learned a lot about software development while at northcoders, but the most significant thing I took from the Bootcamp, was the importance of collaborating with others.
